PSC Alert (VB Submitted Code)
------------------------------------

This is very simple in nature.  The PSC Alert application
will monitor the scrolling newest uploads list for VB
on the Planet Source Code site and notify you when a new
upload has appeared.

PSC Alert runs in the System Tray and the icon
will flash when a new upload is detected.

Simply double click on the tray icon to go to the
newest uploads page.

The ZIP DOES NOT contain the SYSTRAY.OCX which you will need.
I agree with PSC that OCX's should not be posted so I posted
it at my site.  You can obtain the OCX at:
------------------------------------
ftp://24.7.173.85/systray.ocx
------------------------------------
You can find out more about me and my projects at:

------------------------------------
Remember you will have to register the OCX with REGSVR32
if you decide to trust me and download it.

The code is very simple and I am sure many of you can
customize it to provide more functionality, like monitor
other areas of PSC and to set user definded times to check.

I just wanted to post this like this while it is still
simple in nature.
